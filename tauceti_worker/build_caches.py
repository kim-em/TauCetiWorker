"""tauceti_worker.build_caches — pooling the Lean build caches across workers.

Mathlib's `.ltar` cache and the elan toolchain directory hold artifacts every worker fetches
identically, but the per-worker `$HOME` that isolate_home() creates for CREDENTIALS made both
per-worker too. Measured on a five-worker fleet: of one week's 10.2 GB of `.ltar` traffic, 5.2 GB was
a file another worker on the same disk already had, and 22 toolchain installs covered 6 distinct
toolchains.

The two caches are pooled differently, because they are written differently.

`elan` is pooled by pointing every worker at one `ELAN_HOME`. Installing a toolchain takes a
per-toolchain lock, unpacks into a temporary directory and renames it into place, so two workers
racing for the same toolchain is safe. `LAKE_CACHE_DIR` is deliberately kept per-worker even so: it
normally lives under the toolchain directory, it is written during builds rather than once at
install, and nothing here has established that concurrent writers are safe.

Mathlib's `.ltar` cache is NOT pooled by pointing workers at one directory, which was this module's
first design and was wrong. `lake exe cache get` takes no lock, and until every checkout runs a
Mathlib new enough to carry per-process temporary names (leanprover-community/mathlib4#42752), two
concurrent runs in one directory share `curl.cfg` and share each `<hash>.ltar.part`. The bad outcome
is not a failed round: it is a corrupt `.ltar` left under a name the cache trusts forever after, for
every worker AND the operator, until someone deletes it by hand. That risk peaks exactly when the
pool would pay off most — just after a Mathlib bump, when several workers fetch the same 8,600 files
within minutes of each other.

So each worker keeps downloading into its own directory, and the pool is a hardlink farm that only
ever gains COMPLETE files. Before each round, `sync_pool` promotes the worker's finished `.ltar`s
into the pool and hydrates the worker's directory with everything the pool has that it lacks. The
worker then downloads only what nobody on the machine has, having written nothing another process
can see mid-write: a hardlink is atomic, and a name that exists is never overwritten. Disk is
unchanged by all this, since a link is not a copy.
