"""tauceti_worker.paths — install-location detection and self-invocation helpers.

`HERE` is the single source of truth for where the worker's bundled assets (prompts/, scripts/)
and runtime dirs (state/, checkouts/, logs/) live. It must resolve to the SAME directory the
old single-file `tauceti` used: the repo root in a source checkout, and the package dir in an
installed wheel. We detect which by asking whether `prompts/` sits beside the modules — only true
in the wheel (where pyproject force-includes it into the package); in a checkout prompts/ stays at
the repo root, one level up.
