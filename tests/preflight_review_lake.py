"""preflight() gates a HOST authoring round on a local `lake` toolchain — but review is not an
authoring stage: it runs the fetched-on-demand review engine and never compiles. Since the sandbox
default flipped to host, `tauceti work --only review` runs on the host by default, so a stray `lake`
requirement would falsely block every review-only machine that has no Lean toolchain. This test pins
that review-host preflight passes without `lake`, while an authoring stage still requires it.

Exit 0 = both cases agree; 1 = a mismatch."""
