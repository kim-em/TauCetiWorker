"""How the Lean build caches are shared between workers, and how they are deliberately not.

The per-worker $HOME that isolate_home() creates for CREDENTIALS also made Mathlib's `.ltar` cache and
the elan toolchain directory per-worker, so on a five-worker fleet half of one week's 10.2 GB of
`.ltar` traffic was a file another worker on the same disk already had, and 22 toolchain installs
covered 6 distinct toolchains. Two different fixes, because the two caches are written differently:

  * toolchains are shared outright (`ELAN_HOME`), since an install takes a lock and lands by rename;
  * Mathlib's cache is NOT, because `lake exe cache get` takes no lock and older checkouts write
    fixed-name temporaries, so two workers in one directory can leave a corrupt `.ltar` under a name
    every later run trusts. It is pooled by hardlinking COMPLETE files instead, before the agent runs.
  * Lake's own store stays per-worker: it is written throughout a build, not once at install.

These assertions pin that split, the sentinel path a round child takes, and the pool exchange itself
(promote then hydrate, transient files never pooled, an existing name never redefined).

Exit 0 = all assertions hold; 1 = a mismatch.
