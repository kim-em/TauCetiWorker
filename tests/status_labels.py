"""Regression guard for the survey's status-label breakdown — the per-round "open PRs" line.

The line replaced a bare non-draft / build-green count with totals bucketed by TauCeti's status labels
(the STATUS_LABELS pipeline), each paired with the subset the worker itself authored. This locks in:
  - every STATUS_LABELS bucket is present and in that fixed order (a zero bucket is still listed);
  - a bucket's total counts open NON-DRAFT PRs carrying that label; drafts never count;
  - `mine` counts only the subset authored by the passed-in identity;
  - the formatted line spells out 'mine' on the first entry and pairs (total, mine) for every entry.

Exit 0 = all assertions hold; 1 = a mismatch.
