"""The worker's Claude config dir carries its own instruction surface, not the operator's.

isolate_home used to symlink `CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json` and `skills` out of the operator's real
config dir, so every authoring round loaded whatever that operator keeps there — on the fleet this
was measured on, a 7 KB personal CLAUDE.md and 63 personal skills (~5,500 tokens per round), several
of whose rules contradict the task prompt. seed_worker_claude_config replaces that with the same
clean room the review engine already builds for a reviewer.

Pinned here:

  1. A fresh config dir gets no operator CLAUDE.md, no operator settings.json, and no operator skills
     shelf — but does get the worker's own settings.json and the single `pi` skill $PI_RUN resolves.
  2. Tooling the worker shells out to (swap-account, bin, config.json) is still symlinked: none of it
     reaches a prompt.
  3. An existing worker home is migrated — a symlink WE created into the operator's dir is removed —
     while anything the operator put there by hand (a real file, a symlink elsewhere) survives, and a
     settings.json already written is not overwritten.
  4. $TAUCETI_INHERIT_CLAUDE_CONFIG=1 restores the old wholesale mirroring.

Exit 0 = all assertions hold; 1 = a mismatch.
