"""spread_review_candidates randomizes the review pick so concurrent workers don't all converge on the
same lowest-numbered PR and collide on the reviewer's in-progress marker.

It must (a) preserve the candidate set exactly (never drop, duplicate, or invent a PR), and (b) actually
vary the order across workers — modelled here as two independent RNG streams (each worker is its own
process). The engine's marker remains the real de-contention backstop; this only spreads the first pick.

Exit 0 = all cases agree; 1 = a mismatch.
