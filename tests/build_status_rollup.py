"""Regression guard for PRInfo.from_json's build signal.

`statusCheckRollup` mixes two node types: CheckRun (carries `name`/`conclusion`) and StatusContext
(carries `context`/`state`). The required `build` result the merge gate reads is a commit STATUS
(context=="build"), posted by the trusted sandboxed-build workflow. A check-run reflects a JOB's
outcome, which can go red on a transient INFRA / status-report hiccup while the authoritative status
is green (the false-red that once wedged a green PR into fix-ci), so it is NOT a build signal.

The rules this locks in:
  - the commit STATUS (context=="build") is the SOLE authority for the build signal;
  - a check-run named "build" is IGNORED entirely — regardless of the head owner (fork or same-repo)
    — so the signal never depends on a job's check-run again;
  - build_success needs a non-empty, unanimously-SUCCESS set of statuses; build_failed needs any
    failing state; the two are mutually exclusive and never invent a verdict from nothing.

Exit 0 = all cases classify correctly; 1 = a mismatch.
