"""With --auto-refresh, the worker renews its Claude access token instead of stalling on HTTP 401.

An unattended `tauceti work --loop` has nobody to re-run `claude` for it, so a token expiry ends the
run: every poll reads 401 and sleeps. An operator who has told us the credential file is exclusively
this worker's can opt into renewing it.

The opt-in is the point of most of these cases. A refresh token is single-use, so every path where the
token might not be ours — no opt-in, a stripped worker mirror, an inspecting caller — must leave it
alone, or the process that shares the file is left holding a credential the server has retired.
