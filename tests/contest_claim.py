"""Contest-claim dedup logic (the 👀-on-the-reply cross-fleet lock).

A fresh author CONTEST reply re-opens a cleanly-reviewed PR. Two workers surveying within the same
window both used to fire (the old suppressor was a per-worker counter that couldn't coordinate across
isolated stores). The claim now lives on GitHub: a 👀 reaction on the contesting reply, TTL'd so a
crashed worker's claim frees itself. This harness pins the pure decision — given a comment's reactions,
is the contest claimed? — without touching the live API (the reaction round-trip is exercised live in
the GitHub class; here we stub `reactions()` and assert the survey-time skip/fire decision).

Exit 0 = all cases agree; 1 = a mismatch.
