"""A failing `tauceti-progress` subcommand writes its WHOLE output down, not a clipped prefix.

The regression this pins: `plan`'s output used to be sliced to 400 characters straight into the main
log. A Python traceback is longer than that before it reaches the exception, so every progress
failure logged the entry point, a cache path, and nothing about what went wrong. One such failure
latched the worker's error breaker and stopped all progress reporting for five days; diagnosing it
meant re-running the command by hand, because the error itself had never been written down.

The bounds matter as much as the saving. A line COUNT bounds nothing when a tool dies without
printing a newline, and the resulting text goes both to an operator's terminal and into an exception.
