"""The review rubrics reach an authoring round as one readable file.

Measured over 230 rounds that opened a PR: codex named a rubric file in 90% of them, claude in 4%,
against a prompt that told both to read them. Reading eleven files is a turn of orientation every
round pays, and 79% of PRs need a second review round afterwards. So the worker concatenates the
rubrics once, per round, and the prompt points at that one path.

Pinned here:

  1. The bundle contains every angle rubric plus the shared protocol, and each is labelled with the
     file it came from.
  2. The reference documents are excluded: the engine splices those into ONE rubric's prompt, and the
     largest of them is bigger than every rubric put together.
  3. It is written OUTSIDE the review checkout. fetch_ref resets that checkout hard and cleans it at
     the start of every round, so a bundle written inside would be deleted before the agent read it.
  4. It is byte-identical between rounds that fetched the same rubrics, so a round's prompt does not
     churn for no reason.
  5. A rubrics directory that is missing or empty yields None rather than raising: the round should
     fall back to the glob, not die.

Exit 0 = all assertions hold; 1 = a mismatch.
