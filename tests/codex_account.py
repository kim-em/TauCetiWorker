"""--account asserts WHICH ChatGPT account a Codex round will spend under, and stops the round when it
is the wrong one. Nothing else can answer that question: `codex login status` prints only "Logged in
using ChatGPT" (no email), and the model cannot introspect its own account — so the identity is read
out of $CODEX_HOME/auth.json, which is the file `codex` itself authenticates with.

The properties that matter, and why each is a property rather than an implementation detail:
  - identity is CORRELATED per token, never unioned field-by-field: an account id from one token beside
    an email from another names an account that need not exist, and --account would pass for it;
  - tokens that disagree are reported, not resolved (a half-written credential must not be confidently
    labelled as one account or the other);
  - an API-key credential has no account identity at all, and says so instead of reporting a mismatch;
  - a credential codex would not even use — $CODEX_API_KEY / $CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN outrank auth.json —
    is refused rather than certified, because a pass must mean the checked account is the paying one;
  - malformed shapes fail closed instead of raising: this runs in a doctor row and a preflight;
  - a mismatch NEVER switches accounts — it fails with instructions, which is the whole contract;
  - the message points at the operator's REAL ~/.codex under an isolated home, not at the mirror the
    worker reads, and names $CODEX_HOME in the commands so a copy-paste cannot revoke another account.

Exit 0 = every case agrees; 1 = a mismatch.
