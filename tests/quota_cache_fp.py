"""The quota cache must be keyed by the credentials it was fetched under.

When the operator rotates to a different account, the cached usage is for the WRONG account. Keying the
entry on a credential fingerprint makes a rotation read as a cache miss immediately, instead of serving
stale numbers until the (1-hour, for claude) TTL lapses, which used to leave workers sleeping on another
account's exhausted-looking quota. Dependency-free; no network.
